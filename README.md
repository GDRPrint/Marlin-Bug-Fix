Compile Issues In VS Windows Marlin 2.0
Hi I'm Albie in Canada. New 3D printer user Aug 2020, Ender 3 Pro, purchased by one of my sons, 1 mech Eng other Bio-Med eng student, I am production mgr of the printer, ( ahem ). Printer is running well, we upgraded parts out of the gate, have very good quality prints after reading and watching a lot of Youtube etc. sons use Solidworks, mech is very highly skilled in it, I am learning. I have very strong skill set in using tools and running the printer etc.Using a good variety of material, so far everything going well, pleased with machine and product. We do automotive parts, gaskets, household updates and repair items of everyday use, sons are big in cars Japanese mostly, building everything needed and upgrading to mod them.
My biggest struggle is upgrading the firmware etc, using VS and compiling etc. Using Win 10 pro, getting errors on Marlin V 2.0
